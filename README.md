# Managing multiple forms in a Visual Studio C# project

This project illustrates different ways of managing multiple forms in a Visual Studio C# project. It will be useful for prjects such as the ones developed by Otago Polytechnic Auckland International Campus students who are developing applications for their Studio 2 course.

FormMain.cs form is the main form that links the other example forms together. Look at the button event handlers and the comments there to see how to:

- Display Modal forms that display in-front of another form.

- Display a form that hides it parent form.

- How to return back to the form you came from.
